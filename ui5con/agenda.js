The application can be used to make a photo of a business card. The image will be analyzed by the Google Vision API and afterwards the text will be feed into the Google Named Entity Recognition Engine. Based on some look up tables and regular expressions typical attributes like first name, last name, phone number and email address are extracted. The data will be saved in the local storage of the device. If multiple clients like a smartphone and a desktop PC want to share business card data they can join together through a WebRTC session and data can be send through this connection.\n\nThe session will have the style of a code review session that starts with cloneing the project in SAP Web IDE afterwards going through the different steps and have a look how the different parts are engineered.\n\nPresenter:\nManuel Blechschmidt studied at the Hasso-Plattner-Institut and is the CEO of Incentergy GmbH a consulting company focused on SaaS software systems. Currently he works in the agriculture business and helps farmers to do their business. On the weekends he researches for the most innovative technologies and builds prototypes to evaluate them.
